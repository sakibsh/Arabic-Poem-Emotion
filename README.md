### Abstract:

The automatic classification of poetry into categories such as author, era, or emotion is a challenging yet fascinating problem. Traditional approaches often rely on feature engineering and machine learning. However, this paper breaks new ground by applying deep learning techniques to classify Arabic poetry into emotional categories.

A new dataset of 9,452 Arabic poems labeled with emotions—Joy, Sadness, and Love—was developed for this study. Various deep learning models were trained on this dataset, including one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1DCNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which achieved F1-scores of 0.62, 0.62, and 0.53, respectively.

Notably, the AraBERT model, an Arabic adaptation of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), outperformed other models with an accuracy of 76.5% and an F1-score of 0.77, setting a new state-of-the-art for Arabic poetry emotion classification.
